# Standard Datasets

Implementing algorithms and evaluating results on popular datasets.

#1 IRIS dataset using Support Vector Regressor

#2 Boston Housing dataset

      -Initially using linear model to evaluate dataset
      
      -MSE to check model performance
      
      -Using GBM to reduce MSE value

#3 Loan Prediction dataset using k-Fold Cross Validation        
      
#4 Insurance Claim Prediction using XGBoost

#5 Credit Card Fraud detection using RandomForestClassifier and Logistic Regression

      -Comparing performances of the two libraries in fraud detection
      
      -Shuffing dataset to handle imbalance of fraud and non-fraud cases
      
#6 Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost Library
