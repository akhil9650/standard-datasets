# Standard Datasets

Implementing algorithms and evaluating results on popular datasets like iris, home loan prediction and titanic.

#1 IRIS dataset using Support Vector Regressor

#2 Boston Housing dataset

      -Initially using linear model to evaluate dataset
      
      -MSE to check model performance
      
      -Using GBM to reduce MSE value

#3 Loan Prediction dataset using k-Fold Cross Validation        
      
#4 Insurance Claim Prediction using XGBoost

#5 Credit Card Fraud detection using RandomForestClassifier and Data Visualisation

#6 Credit Card Fraud Detection using XGBoost Library
