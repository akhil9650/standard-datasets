# Standard Datasets
Implementing algorithms and evaluating results on popular datasets like iris, home loan prediction and titanic.
#1 IRIS dataset using Support Vector Regressor
#2 Boston Housing dataset
      -Initially using linear model to evaluate dataset
      -Using MSE to check model performance
      -Using GBM to reduce MSE value
